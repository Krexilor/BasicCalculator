# üíª Basic Calculator

A sleek, retro terminal-themed calculator built using only client-side technologies. It features a custom neon glow, dynamic background effects, and a responsive design.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Terminal Aesthetic:** Uses custom dark backgrounds, monospace fonts, and neon pink/red accents.
* **Breathing Glow:** Attribution text features a pulsing, semi-transparent glow effect.
* **Dynamic Background:** Animated symbols stream outward from the center, enhancing the digital, command-line feel.
* **Client-Side Only:** Runs entirely in the browser‚Äîno server-side requirements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is intentionally minimal and uses a core set of client-side web technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the structural markup.
* **CSS3:** For styling, including custom animations (`@keyframes`) for the glow and streaming effects.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Implements all calculator logic (handling input, operations, and display updates).
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used via CDN for rapid utility-first styling and layout.
